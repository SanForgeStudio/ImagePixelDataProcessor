##

This is a straightforward application tool made in python for generating image pixel data, which enables you to transform images into a set of variables that you can use in your programming projects.

# Description
This tool simplifies the process of extracting pixel data from an image and converting it into a format that can be used in your programming applications. It is particularly useful when you need to work with pixel data for tasks like image processing, computer vision, or graphics programming. By generating pixel data in a format that can be directly integrated into your code, this tool streamlines the development of image related applications.

# How to use

To use this start the start.py in the source, after you installed all the required libraries.

-  When you start, a windows application starts, and gives you a bunch of options and features.
-  You can load your desired image in the top left menubar and click on Open Image.
-  You can generate the pixel data by clicking generate pixel data.
-  When you wanna return to the info tab you can click return to menu


# Features

Here are a few features, that are currently working in this tool.

## Current Features:

- **Pixel Data Extraction:** Extract pixel data from the selected image within your root folder.
- **Application / Editor:** This tool is a fully working windows application.
- **Image Opener:** You can open your desired images for pixel data generation.

## Upcomming Features:

- Integrated image viewer feature
- Zoom, Rotate, Features in the viewer.
- And a bunch more stuff

# Installation

You can install the Image Pixel Data Processor by following these simple steps:

**Change the Directory:**
```bash
cd your-project-path
Example: C:\Users\Name\Desktop\PixelDataImageProcessor-main\Source
```

**Install Dependencies (Make sure you have Python and pip installed):**

Because we use 2 external dependancies you will have to install them.

```bash
pip install (the required dependancies)

```

Run the Application:
